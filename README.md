### Greenland Sagas - Udacity VR Nanodegree Capstone Achievements Met List

#### Fundamentals Category 

##### Scale
- Player character is a normal sized person slightly taller than the Viking characters. 
- However, the player is smaller than the buildings and trees that are in the landscape. 
- Buildings and trees reflect a valid proportion to the player. 

##### Animation 
- Viking characters have animation clips that are triggered via script based on their interaction
with the player. 
- Most characters also have goals in mind and play their animations according to those goals.
- For example, enemy units would change to patrol, chase, and attack animations based on their 
vicinity to the player.

##### Lighting 
- Various point lights are found in different buildings to light up darker areas. 
- They are presented as torches on the walls or pillars. 
- A directional light acts as the main sunlight that casts the rays at an angle to create a dusk 
setting.

##### Locomotion 
- Use of waypoints on the ground to simulate player movement across the map. 
- Users interact with it by hovering over it and gazing or touching it. 
- Complements the adventure game by acting as player walk movement. 

##### Physics
- The buildings, items, and characters move or stay in the landscape because of the simulated gravity. 
- They act as colliders to the player by acting as blockers to the player's movement. 

#### Completeness

##### Gamification 
- The app predicates on a game to collect 3 orbs as a way to win the game. 
- The player can die if he/she loses their life points. 
- An inventory system exists to count the number of orbs and items collected.  

##### Diegetic UI
- The orbs, items, and characters can be seen as interactable when the gaze input changes shape as the player
hovers them. 
- There is no text to tell the player nor is there any on the waypoints themselves. Players can also see 
they are interactable in the same as the items, orbs, and characters. 

##### Alternative Storyline
- The player can start to collect any orb in any order allowing for multiple ways to win the game. 
- When communicating with the different characters, the player can choose their own response and the 
characters in the game will react in a different way depending on the player's choice. 
- Players can therefore collect info in different ways and play differently. 

#### Challenges

##### User Testing 
- I had Katie be my tester and she used the Google Cardboard and Samsung S6 Edge Plus to test the game.
- She is in her 20s and this is the second time using a VR app. 

Positives 
- Overall she liked the experience because of the expansiveness of the world she was exploring. 
- She also found the characters to be cute and communicating with them was rather interesting. 
- Collecting the items and moving about the map was also quite intuitive. 

Negatives 
- The message view that popped up was sometimes out of place in the VR version. 
- This led to her having move around the view in order to see the texts.
